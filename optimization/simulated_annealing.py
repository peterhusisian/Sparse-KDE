General simulated annealing algorithm
initial_state is the starting solution
- randomized appropriately through the domain space
initial_temp is the starting temperature
- best if matches closely with the general range of the function space
final_temp is the ending temperature
alpha is the step size of the temperature as it goes from initial_temp to final_temp
get_cost(x) is the cost function with which to evaluate state x
get_neighbors(x) gets the neighbors of state x
